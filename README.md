## Description 

Odin Recipe Project is a project aimed at creating a user-friendly recipe website using HTML. The website will consist of at least three separate pages, each featuring a unique recipe. Each recipe page will include the following sections:


1. Recipe Name: The title of the recipe, grabbing your attention and giving you a sneak peek into the delightful dish you'll be preparing.

2. Description: A brief introduction to the dish, providing insights into its flavor profile.

3. Ingredients: A list of all the ingredients required to prepare the dish.

4. Cooking Steps: A step-by-step guide that will walk you through the cooking process. We have broken down each step into simple instructions, making it easy for even novice chefs to follow along.
