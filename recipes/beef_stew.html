    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            1 tablespoon of butter
            1 pound of beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
            4 Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
            1.5 cups of mushrooms, halved
            1 onion, cut into 6 wedges
            2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
            2 cloves of garlic, minced
            3 cups of beef broth
            1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
            1 tablespoon tomato paste
            1 teaspoon salt
            ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
            ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>Gather all ingredients.

            Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select the Sauté function. Melt butter in the pot. Cook beef chuck cubes in batches until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch.
            
            Return all beef chuck cubes to the pot. Add potatoes, mushrooms, onion, carrots, and garlic; cover with beef broth. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, salt, pepper, and rosemary.
            
            Close and lock the lid. Select Meat/Stew function, according to the manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
            
            Release pressure using the natural-release method, according to the manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</ol>
