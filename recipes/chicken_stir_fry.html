    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            4 cups of water
            2 cups of white rice
            2/3 cup of soy sauce
            1/4 cup of brown sugar
            1 tablespoon of cornstarch
            1 tablespoon of minced fresh ginger
            1 tablespoon of minced garlic
            1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
            3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced
            2 tablespoons of sesame oil, divided
            1 head of broccoli, broken into florets
            1 onion, cut into large chunks
            1 cup of sliced carrots
            1 can of sliced water chestnuts, drained
            1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.

            Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.

            Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.

            Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.
