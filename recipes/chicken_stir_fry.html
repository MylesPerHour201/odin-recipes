            <li>2 cups of white rice</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of soy sauce</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon of cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sesame oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 head of broccoli, broken into florets</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>1 cup of sliced carrots</li>
            <li>1 can of sliced water chestnuts, drained</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</li>
